The good
- Equipment/setups were (mostly) solid
    - Lots of setups 
    - Every setup had stagelist + big number
    - Double stream w/ commentary across the room
- Mostly ran on time (Pool A2 :skull:)
- Top cut was super competitive and fun to watch

The bad
- Pool A2 ran an hour behind
- Room too hot
-
